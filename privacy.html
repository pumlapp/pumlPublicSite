					</ul>
					<p><strong>WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
					<p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside Australia. It may also be processed by staff operating outside Australia who work for us or for one of our suppliers. The destination the data will be stored and processed will be India, Thailand, Vietnam, Switzerland, Germany, The Philippines, Canada and United Kingdom. These staff may be engaged in the fulfilment of your request, order or reservation, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
					<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
					<p><strong>YOUR RIGHTS</strong></p>
					<p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at business@PUML.io.</p>
					<p>Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>
					<p><strong>ACCESS TO INFORMATION</strong></p>
					<p>The Australian Privacy Principles give you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with those principles and the Privacy Act.</p>
					<p>We will take all reasonable steps to correct any information you find inaccurate. Should we deny access and or refuse to correct your personal information, we will provide you with reasons that will be based on the grounds provided by the Privacy Act. All requests for access to personal information should be made e-mail to business@PUML.io.</p>
					<p><strong>COMPLAINTS</strong></p>
					<p>We place a high priority on effectively dealing with any complaints you might have about breach of your privacy. We prefer that complaints about breaches of the Privacy Act and the Australia Privacy Principles are made or confirmed in writing so that we can be sure about the details of the complaint. Generally, we will only accept complaints from an individual who believes an act or practice of us has interfered with their privacy and may have breached one of the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>
					<p>A complaint should identify whether it is about:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>the collection, use or disclosure of personal information;</li>
					<li>the security or storage of personal information;</li>
					<li>the accuracy of personal information;</li>
					<li>a refusal to give access to, change or delete personal information.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Our Privacy Officer will normally deal with privacy complaints. If the Privacy Officer is involved in the conduct the complaint is about, the complaint will be dealt with by an alternative officer appointed by us who was not involved in the complaint.</p>
					<p>We will attempt to confirm with the complainant:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>their understanding of the conduct relevant to the complaint;</li>
					<li>their understanding of the Australian Privacy Principles relevant to the conduct;</li>
					<li>what they expect as an outcome.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We will inform the person making the complaint:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>whether we will conduct an investigation;</li>
					<li>the name, title and contact details of the investigating officer.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>After we have completed our enquiries, we will contact the complainant, usually in writing, to advise the outcome and invite a response to our conclusions about the complaint. If a response is received, we will assess it and advise if we have changed our view.</p>
					<p>If the complainant is unsatisfied with the outcome, we will advise further options including, if appropriate, review by the Privacy Commissioner within the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.</p>
					<p><strong>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
					<p>Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy.</p>
					<p><strong>CONTACT</strong></p>
					<p>Questions, comments and requests regarding this privacy policy are welcomed and should be addressed to business@PUML.io.</p>
